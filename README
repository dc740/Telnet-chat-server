Telnet chat server (yes, telnet) written in scheme.

I wrote this back when Racket was PLT Scheme. So it's kind of old, but it still works.

Just load the program and run:
$ racket
> (load "singleThread6.scm")
> (start)

it will start a chat server on port 8081. Connect to it using telnet. Every thing you send will be broadcasted to other connected telnet sessions.

To change your nick type:
nick myNewNick

To quit the chat session type:
exit
